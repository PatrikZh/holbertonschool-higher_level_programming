Module 2-matrix_divided

def matrix_divided(matrix, div) defines the division of all elements of a matrix

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Function that provides if the matrix works with positive integers
	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Quotients are rounded to 2 decimal places
The original matrix will be the same

	>>> print(matrix)
	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Function that sees if the matrix is not a list of lists 

	>>> matrix = "string"
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

	>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 6))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, "hello"]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 7))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Function that sees if rows and size don't have the same length
	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3, 7],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 7))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Function that sees if div is not an integer/float

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "hello"))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

Function that sees if div can be 0
	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
